# **HA-Tools**

Welcome to **HA-Tools**, a practical collection of tools, configurations, and scripts designed to enhance your Home Assistant setup on a budget. This repository focuses on functionality, simplicity, and accessibility, making it easier for others to replicate and adapt these solutions for their own home automation projects.

---

## **Overview**

This repository is divided into directories, each addressing a specific aspect of home automation:

- **[`smart-lock/`](smart-lock/)**: Implements a standalone NFC-based smart lock system.
- **[`ldap-cache/`](ldap-cache/)**: Adds Active Directory (AD) or LDAP synchronization to automate user management hourly.
- **[`nws-wiz-alerts/`](nws-wiz-alerts/)**: Automations for Wiz lights to perform specific actions based on National Weather Service (NWS) alerts.

Each directory contains everything needed for implementation, including code, configuration files, and guides.
