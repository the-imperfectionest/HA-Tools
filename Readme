# **Home Assistant Budget Security Project**

This repository is not meant to be a beautifully polished GitHub project. Instead, it is a practical collection of tools, configurations, and instructions aimed at helping people secure their homes using Home Assistant OS on a tight budget.

---

## **Overview**

This project provides modular directories for various functionalities:
- **`smart-lock/`**: Standalone NFC-based smart lock code, configuration, and a basic how-to.
- **`ldap-cache/`**: Adds Active Directory (AD) or LDAP synchronization to automate user management hourly.
- **`nws-wiz-alerts/`**: Automations for Wiz lights to perform specific actions based on National Weather Service (NWS) alerts.

Each module is designed to work independently but can be combined for a more robust home security and safety setup.
