This is not beautiful Git. I do not intend to make it such.

My goal with this is to be able to have people easily replicate my work with Home Assistant OS to better secure their house on a tight budget

I added in some tools, like AD integration, and I'll make ChatGPT write a howto, where to place the files and such. Even include yaml's and stuff once sanitzed.
