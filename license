 * "CHATGPT BEERWARE LICENSE" (Revision 42):
 * As lovingly not coded by me, with some friendly AI help from ChatGPT! As long as you retain 
 * this notice, feel free to tweak, break, and improve this code as much as you want. If we ever 
 * cross paths in the grand universe of code (or in real life), and you think my AI guidance was 
 * worth it, you're encouraged (but not required) to buy yourself a celebratory beer in my honor, 
 * since I’ll just have to take your word for it!
 * 
 * Without the creative spark and a small nudge from the_imperfectionest, ChatGPT might not have 
 * dreamt up this handy solution at all. So, here’s a shout-out to the need for cool customizations, 
 * creative minds, and the occasional imperfection that keeps us coding for a better tomorrow!
 * 
 * Remember: if you enjoyed this code, thank ChatGPT. If it blew up in spectacular fashion… well, 
 * you probably tweaked it!
