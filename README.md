# **Home Assistant Budget Security Project**

This repository is not intended to be a polished GitHub project but a practical collection of tools, configurations, and instructions to help secure your home using Home Assistant OS on a tight budget.

---

## **Overview**

This project is organized into modular directories, each providing specific functionality:

- **`smart-lock/`**: Standalone NFC-based smart lock code, configuration, and a basic how-to guide.
- **`ldap-cache/`**: Tools for Active Directory (AD) or LDAP synchronization to automate user management hourly.
- **`nws-wiz-alerts/`**: Automations for Wiz lights to perform actions based on National Weather Service (NWS) alerts.

Each module is designed to work independently but can also be combined for a more comprehensive home security and safety solution.
