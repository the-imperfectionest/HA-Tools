LDAP Cache Script for Home Assistant
This script fetches user data from an LDAP server, formats it as JSON, and saves it to a cache file. It's designed for environments where LDAP integration is required, and caching user data simplifies subsequent operations.

üìã Prerequisites
To use this script on a Home Assistant OS instance, you'll need the following:

File Editor Add-on:

Provides a simple file editor to manage and edit configuration files directly within Home Assistant.
Install it from the Add-on Store under Settings > Add-ons > Add-on Store.
SSH & Web Terminal Add-on:

Enables SSH access for running commands on the Home Assistant OS.
Install it from the Add-on Store, then configure it under Settings > Add-ons > SSH & Web Terminal.
LDAP Utilities:

The script requires ldapsearch, which can be installed by running:
bash
Copy code
apk add openldap-clients
This command works directly in the SSH terminal on Home Assistant OS.
üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps
Follow these steps to set up and use the script on Home Assistant:

1. Enable SSH Access
Install and configure the SSH & Web Terminal Add-on.
Ensure you can access the Home Assistant OS via SSH.
2. Install ldapsearch
Open the SSH terminal.
Run the following command to install ldapsearch:
bash
Copy code
apk add openldap-clients
Confirm installation by typing:
bash
Copy code
ldapsearch --help
If the help menu appears, ldapsearch is installed successfully.
3. Download the Script
Use the File Editor Add-on or scp (secure copy) to upload the script to a desired location in the Home Assistant file system (e.g., /config/ldap_cache.sh).
4. Configure the Script
Open the script file using the File Editor or a text editor of your choice:

bash
Copy code
nano /config/ldap_cache.sh
Update the following configuration fields:

SERVER: Replace with your LDAP server URL.
BIND_DN: Replace with your LDAP Bind Distinguished Name.
SEARCH_BASE: Replace with your LDAP search base.
CACHE_FILE: Set the path where the cache file will be stored (e.g., /config/ad_user_cache.json).
Set the Password: For security, set your LDAP password as an environment variable:

bash
Copy code
export LDAP_PASSWORD="your_password_here"
5. Test the Script
Make the script executable:
bash
Copy code
chmod +x /config/ldap_cache.sh
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
/config/ldap_cache.sh
Verify the output:
Check the cache file for JSON data:
bash
Copy code
cat /config/ad_user_cache.json
6. Automate Script Execution
To keep the cache updated regularly, you can set up a cron job or a Home Assistant automation. Example automation (using the Home Assistant SSH Add-on):

Create an automation to run the script periodically.
Use the shell_command integration:
yaml
Copy code
shell_command:
  update_ldap_cache: "/bin/bash /config/ldap_cache.sh"
Trigger the shell_command.update_ldap_cache in automations.
üöë Troubleshooting
JSON Validation Fails:

If the cache file has invalid JSON, the script will attempt to correct it automatically.
Check the logs for any errors or inspect the cache file manually.
Permission Issues:

Ensure the script has executable permissions (chmod +x /config/ldap_cache.sh).
LDAP Connectivity:

Use the ldapsearch command to test connectivity:
bash
Copy code
ldapsearch -H ldap://your-server.com -D "cn=your-user,dc=example,dc=com" -w your_password -b "dc=example,dc=com"
